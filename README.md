This game is made by using python programing language and pygame module of python. 
#### HOW TO PLAY?
Playing it is very simple. Just combine the blocks of the same value into one block of greater value by stacking them. If there is no place to place you block then the game will over.

You can use a cheat by pressing the keys s and b together to reduce the speed of the block dropping which will give you more time to place the block in the right place.
